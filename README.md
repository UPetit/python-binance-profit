# Welcome to python-binance-profit GitHub repository!
## Notes
The script allows you to place a buy order and automatically place an [OCO order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oco.asp) to secure (and exit) your trade.
It's using the binance API python wrapper from @sammchardy [python-binance](https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance)
## Requirements
- Create an API key after logging in to your Binance account https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management:
  - Check both `Enable Reading` and `Enable Spot & Margin Trading`
  - Save carefully your `API key` and your `Secret key` (⚠️ the last one won't be visible again at your next login)
  - Add your Binance API key to a environement variable called `BIN_API_KEY`
  - Add your Binance Secret key to a environement variable called `BIN_SECRET_KEY`
- Install Python 3.6+ (I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for instance)
---
## Installation

## Use cases
### Run a Limit Buy order followed by an OCO Sell order
#### Script logic
The script will check that both the price and the quantity are compliant with Binance rules for the selected symbol.
If both are validated, the limit buy order will be sent to the market and the script will wait until it's filled.
Once it's executed the OCO order will be prepared: the price with profit will be calculated according to the profit percentage that has been provided, same for the stoploss price.
The OCO order will be sent to the market and the script will return the two related orders and then quit.
#### Instructions
1. First, choose the crypto pair you want to trade. We call it the **symbol** (string).
> Example: If you want to trade BTC with USDT, the symbol will be BTCUSDT (as long as this is an available symbol in Binance).
2. Then you have to define how much of the base asset you want to buy. We call it the **quantity** (Decimal).
3. Then you have to define what is the price (for 1 unit of the base asset) you want to buy the quantity defined above. We call it the **price** (Decimal).
> Example: if you trade the **symbol** BTCUSDT, you need to define the BTC (base asset) price in USDT (quote asset) you're willing to pay.
4. Finally have to define your profit and stoploss percentages to exit the trade (this will be applied to the OCO sell order).
We call them respectively **profit** (int)
and **loss** (int).
> If you want to make 2% of profit and put a stoploss a 1%, your profit should be 2 and the loss 1 (as integers between 0 and 100)

⚠️ Please not that if the quantity and/or price formats are not following Binance rules, your Limit buy order won't be validated and the script will stop before submitting to order to the market.
> How to know the prices formats ? Go to the Binance market of your **symbol** you want to trade, check the current prices and quantities going through the market to know how many decimals you can use for both of them. For instance for BTCUSDT: the BTC quantity is using 6 decimals and the USDT price is using 2 decimals.

5. Run the script using the parameters you've just defined by replacing with your values
```
python execute_orders.py --symbol YOUR_SYMBOL --quantity YOUR_QUANTITY --price YOUR_PRICE --profit YOUR_PROFIT --loss YOUR_LOSS
```
*Example: If you want to trade BTC against USDT, buy 0.251897 BTC at 31488.69 USDT (per BTC) and then you want to sell it to make a 4% profit and a potential loss of 1%, you'll execute the script like this:*
```
python execute_orders.py --symbol BTCUSDT --quantity 0.251897 --price 31488.69 --profit 4 --loss 1
```

Enjoy!
